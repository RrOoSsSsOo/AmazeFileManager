Also, I'd like to recommend reading 
https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html
Before making changes in code. Existing code itself might not follow this, but you don't have to do same mistakes we did a year ago! 

This app is still in beta stage, hence, you might face some bugs, lack of features.
